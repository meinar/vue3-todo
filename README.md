# Todo App

The Todo app is a simple task manager built using Vue.js. It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible, allowing users to focus on their tasks and be as productive as possible.

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks as needed
- Store tasks locally using the browser's localStorage API
- Drag and drop tasks to reorder them
- Clear completed tasks
- Import/export functionality for saving and loading task lists as JSON files

Any future expansions to the app will keep the goal of being unobtrusive and maximizing productivity in mind.
